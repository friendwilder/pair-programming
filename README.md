Introduction

The idea to solve a problem that I had experienced since the beginning of times was pushing me to spend some time on this personal project, deliver a functional product and then step by step make it better to reach its full potential.

Or in case it can serve a double purpose, I can make small increment commits which will allow people who are learning web development to see the progress and have a better understanding.
